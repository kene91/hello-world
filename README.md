# hello-world

Hello!

I'm in my first semester of college and learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I from Kansas, so I like to travel.  In the last five years I've been to Minneapolis, San Fransisco, Miami Beach, Seattle, Tampa, and plan on going to NYC this summer.  I was in the accounting field (A/P, A/R) for about 16 years. I took some time off and since I'm too young to retire, I'm learning something new.
